## Structure

This Geant4 application was developed for image-based internal dosimetry
calculations in the context of radionuclide therapy.
A virtual phantom is built taking the anatomical information contained in a
Computed Tomography (CT) file. Its geometry, composed by an array of voxels, is
based on G4PhantomParameterisation. Each tissue, represented by a different
density in the CT, can be associated to a different G4Material.
The generation of primaries follows instead the distribution contained in an
emission tomography file, which can be either a Positron Emission Tomography
(PET) or a Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).
For every event, the deposited energy and the absorbed dose are scored in each
voxel which has been hit. At the end of the run, the final result is the
absorbed dose imparted by a cumulative activity corresponding to the total
number of events launched.


## DICOM conversion

The "DICOMconverter" folder contains a hybrid PET/CT study, with the DICOM files
"CT_1.dcm" and "PET_18FDG_1.dcm". Murine images were obtained after ¹⁸F-FDG
injection and are kindly provided by the group of Giorgio Russo from CNR-IBFM.
For the code to work properly, the DICOM files must be converted into TXT files
with the Python script "dcmtotxt.py" (make sure to have the "numpy" and
"pydicom" modules installed). After that, only PET (or SPECT) files must be
converted from TXT to ROOT format by opening using the ROOT macro
"txttoroot.cc". To do that, from bash type:

````bash
cd DICOMconverter
root -q -l 'txttoroot.cc("<TXT file name>","<ROOT file name>")'
````

Finally, the "hu.py" script can be useful to visualize the
distribution of the Hounsfield units (or other arbitrary units) in the CT files.


## How to run the example

After converting the DICOM files in the way just explained, from bash type:

````bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
./radionuclide_dosimetry
````

By doing this, the macro "run.mac" is automatically run, as specified in the
main file. Alternatively, "vis.mac" can be used to visualize the geometry; by
default, only the phantom container is visualized (and not all the voxels).


## General instructions for the application

The source files ("src" folder) can be edited to change the main simulation
settings.
"DetectorConstruction.cc" reads the CT file for the construction of the virtual
phantom (line 170) and manages its composition in terms of G4Materials.
"PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc" selects the PET or SPECT file to sample the
probability distribution of the events (line 29) and sets which radionuclide to
generate (from line 46).
"StackingAction.cc" allows to kill certain particle species when generated by
the radioactive decay.
"VoxelSD.cc" neglects dose deposition in voxels made of air (line 57).
When changing the number of voxels, it is important to update this parameter in
"DetectorConstruction.cc", "EventAction.cc", "PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc" and
"RunAction.cc".


## How to read the results

The simulation output is a standard ROOT file, which can be analyzed with ROOT.
Alternatively, to visualize the dose map using Python-MatPlotLib, the results
must be first processed in ROOT with the macro "read_dose.cc", contained in the
"read" folder. From bash:

````bash
cd read
root -q -l 'read_dose.cc("<ROOT file name>","<TXT file name>")'
````

Subsequently, the TXT file generated can be read by the script
"dosemap_vis.py" in the same folder. With this, the 3D dose map can be
visualized in the three anatomical planes.
